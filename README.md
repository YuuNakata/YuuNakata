**Hey there! 👋**

I'm Raydel, a fullstack developer passionate about scalable architectures and intuitive user experiences.  
I follow SOLID principles, write clean, structured, and well-documented code, and always aim for best practices.

My stack includes Python, C#, TypeScript, SQL, PostgreSQL, React, Astro, Blazor, ASP.NET, Tailwind CSS, and GitHub Actions.  
I work across frontend and backend, designing responsive interfaces, building APIs, and automating workflows with CI/CD.

Beyond coding, I enjoy documenting troubleshooting steps as reusable guides, designing minimalist visuals for apps and portfolios, and experimenting with interactive prototypes using Unity and Godot.

Fun facts:
- Passionate about automation and workflow optimization
- Experienced in competitive programming and algorithmic problem-solving
- I treat every technical challenge as a chance to learn and teach
- I value reproducibility and modular design in every project
- Fluent in Spanish, certified in English (B1)
